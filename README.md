AI Chatbot developed through Rasa. Rasa is helpful in understanding messages, holding conversations, and connecting to messaging channels and APIs.

5. Through Initial Rasa Model we can customize things as much as we want and build our own chatbot.
6. Train the model using command "rasa train"
7. Run the trained model using "rasa run actions & rasa shell"
8. For deployment run this command "rasa run -m models --enable-api --cors "*" --debug" and open index.html

## CONCLUSION
From my perspective, chatbots or smart assistants with artificial intelligence are dramatically changing businesses. 
Our chatbot can reach out to a large audience on messaging apps and be more effective than humans. This would help many people in buying their products for much less price than offered and can increase sales rate in purchasing products from many stores.
